# if i am able to iterate over the object one by one with the help of pointer or loop then it is called a iterator.


# string is not a by default iterator but string is a iterable

# iter() - with this help we can convert any iterable into a iterator.

# next() - this function remember what i have extracted last time and based on that it try to give the next data element.

# we can convert iterable into iterator usig iter function 

# 

l = [1,2,3,4,5] #it is a iterable
# convert l into iterator
il = iter(l)
